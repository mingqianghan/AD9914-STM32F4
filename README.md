# AD9914-STM32F4
This repository provides a guide to the construction and implementation of controlling the AD9914 DDS (Direct Digital Synthesizer) Evaluation Board using the STM32F4 microcontroller through SPI. 
## Set up the AD9914 Evaluation Board
The following set-ups should be completed for the external control of the evaluation board:
- Connect the external power down pin (EXTPDCTL-BUF) to GND.
- Set pins P203, P204, and P205 to disable.
- Connect pins PS0-BUF, PS1-BUF, PS2-BUF to GND.
